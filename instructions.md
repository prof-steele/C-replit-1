# Instructions  
  Create the file *main.c* and write the program
  so that it produces the results shown in the Example Runs below.

  The program will if the green *Run* button is pressed,
  or *./main* is entered in a *shell* window or a *console* window.

  Note that there will be warning or error outputs during
  compilation and linking if there are any issues with the code.
  You are learning to be a *software sorcerer*!
  Study the outputs to learn how to *read the entrails* and 
  figure out how to fix things.

  ## Input: None

  ## Example Run

  The output is shown directly below the example.
  Note that the program prints a *newline* character after the '!'.

  - ./main
    Hello, world. Happy New Year!

  ## Steps
  1. Create single module file using the menu or the 'file +' button.
  2. Add the include statements, main function declaration, and body.
  3. Document the C program with a file comment and a function docstring.
  4. Add the header include needed for using the EXIT_SUCCESS definition.
  5. Research using web site [https://en.cppreference.com/w/c].
  6. Also refer to content at [https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci243/].
  7. Press the *Run* button whenever you are ready to test.
  This button compiles and links the program; then it executes the executable.
  8. Check the output in the *console* window.
  9. Study any errors produced by the compiler and the program.
  10. Add comments/questions to the file comment at the top of main.c.
  11. Submit when ready.

  ## Documentation

File documentation uses either plain 'double-quote' or '/* ... */' format.
Function and variable docstrings must come *before the code component*. 
Below is an internal comment that will not be processed as documentation,
and a docstring comment using 'triple-quote' format C comments.

```
// global, public variable values are deprecated!

/// myvariable is a global public value (deprecated)

int myvariable;
```
